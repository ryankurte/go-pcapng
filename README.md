# go-pcapng

PCAP-NG **writing** and *reading* implementation in golang. Because for reasons that will remain unknown I need packet capture outputs from golang apps.

See [pcapng/pcapng](https://github.com/pcapng/pcapng) for file format specifications.

## Status

WIP. Encoding and writing working, parsing in progress, reading not yet started.
